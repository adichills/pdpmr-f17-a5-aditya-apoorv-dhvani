### Problem Statement:
Given historical airplane on time performance data,offer suggestions for two-hop flights that minimize the chance of missing a connection.

### Implementation high level view

### Implementation

The implementation can be divided into following parts

1.	The first map reduce job fetches all the possible combination of two hop flights based on the input provided. 
+	The mapper fetches all the flights which have the origin equal to origin in the input but destination not equal to that in input (to filter out direct flights). Similarly, it fetches all the flights which have destination equal to destination in the input but origin not equal to origin in input(to filter out direct flights). This way mapper gets all the two hop flights possible between the origin and destination mentioned in the input.
+	The reducer then combines all the two hop flights possible between the given origin  and destination in input.

### Configuration of the machines used

The program was intially run on AWS EMR with one namenode and four datanodes on the whole dataset. 
Later on we increased the number of datanodes to 8 to get a better runtime.

Below is the configuration of the machines used:  
Namenode:   
vCPU: 8   RAM: 16GB   Hard Disk: 70GB  
Datanodes:   
vCPU: 8  RAM:  16GB   Hard Disk: 70GB  

Processors for all the above machines were 64 bit 2.4 GHz Intel Xeon® E5-2676 v3 (Haswell) processors. 
Each vCPU is a hyperthread of an Intel Xeon core.

### Performance  

Following is the perfromance we got on AWS EMR configurations mentioned above.

|Name Nodes | Data Nodes | Runtime|
|-----------|------------|--------|
|1          | 4          | 29 minutes|
|1          | 8          | 15 minutes|


### Results

Following was the input we gave to our model:

```
2001,7,4,JFK,LAX
2001,7,4,BOS,LAX
2001,12,5,DEN,ORD
```

We found out that the total number of two hop flights which were on time was ** 3561 **.
We found out this using actual arrival time, actual departure time and cancelled data while calculating the two hops.

After the first step where we get the two hop flights, by considering only the CRS scheduled time and not the  cancellation time following was the result :-

| Correct Hops 	| Incorrect Hops 	| Total correct Hops |
|-------------	|-------------	  |--------------------|
| 3410         	| 193        	    | 3561               |  

_correct hops : the two hop connection, where both the flights were on time_  
_incorrect hops : the two hop connection, where either of the flights were not on time or cancelled_

```{r echo = FALSE}
df <- data.frame(Two_Hops= factor(c("Correct Hops", "Incorrect Hops")))
Number_of_Hops=c(3410, 193)

library(ggplot2)
plot <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Two_Hops, y=Number_of_Hops, fill=Two_Hops)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#66CC88", "#CC6886"))
print(plot +ggtitle("Hop accuracy hop map reducer"))
```

After the second step when we give the above data to our model for prediction and consider delay and cancellation for prediction, following was the result

| Correct Predicted Hops 	| Incorrect Predicted Hops 	| Total correct Hops |
|-------------	|-------------	  |--------------------|
| 3263         	| 134        	    | 3561               |  

_correct hops : the two hop connection, where both the flights were on time_  
_incorrect hops : the two hop connection, where either of the flights were not on time or cancelled_

```{r echo = FALSE}
df <- data.frame(Two_Hops= factor(c("Correct Hops", "Incorrect Hops")))
Number_of_Hops=c(3263, 134)

library(ggplot2)
plot <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Two_Hops, y=Number_of_Hops, fill=Two_Hops)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#66CC88", "#CC6886"))
print(plot +ggtitle("Hop accuracy after prediction using model"))
```

Precision and accuracy:  

Follwing is the precision and accuracy for our model:-

|Precision|Accuracy|
|-------- |--------|
| 0.96 | 0.91 |

Precision is calculated as ( Number of True Positives ) / (Number of True Positives + Number of False Positives)

Accuracy is calculated as (correct hops fetched/ total correct hops)  

### Conclusion  

We build the model by averaging the delay of the flights and taking the cancellation probability of the flight into consideration. Our final output consisted of 3397 two hop flight suggestions. Out of these records 3263 records were correct predictions (the two hop flight reaches destination on time) and 134 were incorrect predictions (the two hop flight does not reach destination in time).  
We validated our result by comparing it to the actual arrival time, departure time and cancellation time of the flights we have generated as output.  
Overall the accuracy of using the average delay and cancellation probability as model is 91% with a precision of 96%.
